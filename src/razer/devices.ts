/**
 * Razer per-PID capability registry.
 *
 * Razer's protocol is not self-describing: nothing on the wire says which
 * commands a mouse answers, so the only way to know is a table keyed on the
 * exact product id. This is that table, kept apart from the transport in
 * `hid.ts` so adding a model is data rather than code.
 *
 * ## Provenance and what "supported" means here
 *
 * The product list and the transport grouping come from OpenRazer's public
 * supported-device table and mouse driver (see
 * `OPENRAZER_ALL_MICE_DEVELOPER_REFERENCE.md`). Only the entries marked
 * `verified: true` have been exercised against real hardware by this project —
 * everything else is transcribed protocol facts, not a tested driver.
 *
 * Nothing here is a guess about *packets*: every model below is driven by the
 * same 90-byte commands already confirmed on the Viper V3 Pro. What varies per
 * model, and what this table records, is which of those commands are valid,
 * which transaction id the mouse answers on, and what the sensor and radio can
 * actually do.
 *
 * ## Why an unverified entry is safe to ship
 *
 * - A wrong transaction id means the mouse never replies. `readStatus` throws
 *   on the firmware read and the panel reports a connection failure. Nothing
 *   is written.
 * - A wrong capability flag suppresses a command rather than inventing one.
 * - A wrong ceiling is caught by the read-back every setter already performs:
 *   the mouse keeps its own value, the driver notices and reports it.
 *
 * The one thing that would not be safe is sending a command a model does not
 * implement, so unverified models are given the conservative flags below and
 * the asymmetric lift-off *write probe* stays off for all of them.
 *
 * ## Deliberately absent
 *
 * - `legacy/old` (Orochi 2011 `0x0013`, DeathAdder 3.5G `0x0016`/`0x0029`).
 *   These predate the 90-byte report and need direct USB control writes, so
 *   this driver could only ever time out on them.
 * - Orochi V2 Bluetooth (`0x0095`). A Bluetooth HID path is not the USB
 *   control channel and must not be assumed to take the same reports.
 * - Viper Mini (`0x008a`), Viper V4 Pro (`0x00e5`/`0x00e6`) and Cobra
 *   (`0x00a3`), which have their own drivers in this folder. Listing them here
 *   would give two drivers the same device.

 * Products answering on `0x3f`, audited against OpenRazer's mouse driver.
 *
 * ## Why this is a flat list and not a field on the transport presets
 *
 * It was a preset field, and that was wrong for 26 of the 107 products. The
 * transaction id does not follow the transport group, the connection, the
 * model's age or its marketing family — OpenRazer picks it per product id, and
 * the groups interleave all three values:
 *
 * - Basilisk `0x0064` is `0x3f` while Basilisk V2 `0x0085` is `0x1f` and
 *   Basilisk X HyperSpeed `0x0083` is `0xff`.
 * - Viper `0x0078` is `0xff`, Viper 8KHz `0x0091` is `0xff`, Viper Mini SE
 *   `0x009e` is `0x1f`.
 * - Inside one `new-receiver` group: Lancehead Wireless `0x006f` is `0x3f`,
 *   Pro Click `0x0077` is `0x1f`, Basilisk X HyperSpeed `0x0083` is `0xff`.
 *
 * A wrong id is silent — the mouse never replies — so there is no failure mode
 * to catch an inherited guess. Keeping the ids in one auditable block, rather
 * than spread across presets that imply a pattern, is what stops that
 * inheritance happening again.

  // Verified on hardware with the stock HyperSpeed receiver, and the first
  // model to prove `highRatePolling` is genuinely per-PID rather than a
  // property of the transport group or of being wireless: this receiver
  // answers only the legacy divisor-of-1000 command and rejects the extended
  // one (`0x00`/`0x40`) as unsupported. 125/500/1000 Hz were each written and
  // read back.
  //
  // Do not "tidy" this back onto the group default. 0x00a6 is the standing
  // counter-example in the other direction — a 1000 Hz receiver that does use
  // the extended command — so neither the group nor the rate ceiling predicts
  // this, and it can only be settled per product.
  // Lift-off reported working here, so the tracking control stays on — but not
  // the asymmetric pair, which was never exercised. If this model turns out to
  // answer `0x0b`/`0x85` with zeros the way the Basilisk X HyperSpeed does, it
  // will show a permanent "Low" and refuse every level; that is the thing to
  // check before trusting it.

  // Viper V3 Pro SE (`RZ01-0455`). OpenRazer PR #2818 implements it by
  // subclassing the Viper V3 Pro rather than writing a new codec, so the packet
  // format, the DPI pair and the extended polling commands are the same ones
  // `0x00c0`/`0x00c1` already use.
  //
  // Two things are deliberately not inherited from that pair. `verified` stays
  // false — nothing has connected one here, and the V3 Pro's flag was earned by
  // a hardware report on its own product ids. `liftOff` stays false because it
  // cannot be probed: a mouse without the feature answers `0x0b`/`0x85` with
  // status `0x02` and zeros, which decodes as a legitimate "Low".
  //
  // Polling: settled on hardware, and it went the other way from OpenRazer.
  // `0x00df` first shipped here with the 8 kHz ladder because OpenRazer's SE
  // wireless class exposes it. A capture on the stock HyperSpeed receiver has
  // the extended read (`0x00`/`0xc0`) answered with status `0x05` — not
  // supported — and the legacy read (`0x00`/`0x85`) answering a divisor of 1,
  // i.e. 1000 Hz. An outright refusal, not a write that confirms and does
  // nothing, so this needs no rate measurement to settle.

  // Razer's own specification agrees: "1000 Hz normally, up to 8000 Hz with
  // HyperPolling Dongle". The dongle is a different receiver and would enumerate
