/**
 * Feature 0x19B0 (Haptic), as implemented by the MX Master 4 (WPID B042).
 *
 * No public documentation exists for this feature. Everything here was read
 * off hardware by watching Logi Options+ talk to the mouse: a Bolt receiver
 * broadcasts replies to every open handle, and the low nibble of the function
 * byte carries the requester's software id, so the vendor application's own
 * traffic is visible alongside your own.
 *
 * The configuration is a two-byte pair behind get 0x10 / set 0x20.
 *
 * Byte 0 is a flag bitmask. Turning haptics off in Options+ cleared bit 0;
 * turning its battery-saving mode off cleared bit 1; both returned together as
 * 0x03. Ten writes for ten switch toggles, and only those two pairs moved
 * anything — Options+'s per-context switches (Actions Ring, Gestures, Switch
 * Screens) change no device byte at all, so those are decided in its software.
 * Bits 2-7 were 0 throughout and their purpose is unknown, so a write carries
 * them through rather than clearing them.
 *
 * Byte 1 is the strength. Options+'s four presets write exactly the values in
 * LOGITECH_HAPTIC_PRESETS, and capability byte 3 reports 60 as the device
 * default, matching its Medium.
